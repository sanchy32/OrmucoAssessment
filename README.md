TechTest1: Solution to first question
Solved by using logic to account for cases of lines on the same axis (x-axis)

TechTest2: Solution to second question
2 solution version provided: "version_compare" and "version_compare2"
version_compare account for cases of only digits seperated by "." as I expect is the desired requiremnt
version_compare2 accounts for cases of alphanumeric characters used for versioning and any possible non-alphanumeric characters used to seperate version, in the event that that was desired. This should take care of unorthodoc versioning systems like semantic versioning
